<span style="color:black"> In an obsidian, inky oblivion, a gilded hero was born. Rapacious and ravenous, yet resplendently rotund, his luminescent presence evoked a hopeful contrast to his perilous plight. Doomed to eternally dance in the labyrinthian night lands diligently guarded by vengeful spirits, his only hope of survival was to extinguish the sparks of illumination, hidden throughout the realm and drawing on his innate luminescence. Racing, rolling, and running he did all he could to desperately douse each spark before his mortal foes could close in and drain him of his last vestiges of power, without which he would be cursed to join the shadows, another peripatetic soldier in the ghostly garrison. His fervent, frenetic, ferocious zeal to avoid such a fate continuously infuriated his adversaries as he eluded capture and progressed in his quest. He could not say how long he was pursued, nor how many sparks he destroyed, but in the end our golden protagonist was not to be denied. Upon destroying the last leech on his power, he unveiled his full luminance to briefly banish the tireless wraiths, before they could, once again, enact ensorcellment and enchantment to scatter and dilute his intrinsic potency.</p>
<p><span style="color:black"> This is the backstory I contrived in the naivete of childhood, one that I shamelessly used to fill in underwhelming, uninspiring explanations for phenomena. What sounds more interesting to you? That night and day are caused by the rotation of the earth around the sun, or instead that the sky is a portal to shadowlands beyond our reach - where days are attributable to the sun&rsquo;s stupefying success and nights the dark dilution of the sun&rsquo;s light by dark sorcery. Stars the sparks of illumination, the moon a weakened sun, struggling to, once again, regain its full power. But alas, I digress and I&rsquo;ve gotten remarkably off-track. You&rsquo;ve come here to learn (<em>I hope&hellip;</em>) and I have yet to define the main metaphor. I&rsquo;ll do what I can to rectify this divergence, and to do that we must venture back in time, to the era in which this fantastic fabrication was formulated.</p>
<p><span style="color:black"> &ldquo;He&rsquo;s down the hall and to the left.&rdquo; Simple-enough directions, yet somehow I found myself alone, befuddled, and likely lost in the laundry room. With no alternate avenues existing on the route to this desolate location, I came to what I thought at the time was the only logical conclusion, that my friend was hiding and patiently waiting to spring a surprise. Naturally, this set me up for a counter-offensive stealth operation. I silently shuffled over to the washing machine, rapidly raised the lid, stuck my head in and shrilly shrieked, aiming to jolt my friend out of his hideout. <em>&ldquo;James, what are you doing?&quot;</em> An unexpected question by an unannounced adversary destabilized my precarious position, leading me to fall headfirst into wonderland. Okay, it wasn&rsquo;t wonderland, it was a machine full of recently washed sheets that I immediately ruined. Rapidly I righted my position and poked my head above the surface, a washing machine <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Diglett_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Diglett</a>. The inquisitor&rsquo;s, that is my friend&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s, visage emanated equal parts concern and curiousity, before pointing behind me and flatly saying, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s through there.&rdquo;  I slowly turned my head around, and stared at the wall.    (Have her walk through the wall?)</p>
<p>, My friend&rsquo;s mother, t</p>

<p>However, I found naught but wet clothes ready for the next stage of the laundry cycle.</p>

<p>had and uttered her question with equal parts</p>
<p>behind me,  with a genuinely curious and concerned expression.</p>
